# Drum machine
Drum machine project for FreeCodeCamp, built with React. It was a deceptively complex project! I learned a lot about:
* Binding functions to 'this', so that function A can call function B, with each keeping their respective 'this'
* Using ES6 arrow functions to bind originating context and be able to access props in the originating context
* Making setState synchronous with callback functions
* Using the React devtools to troubleshoot state changes and passing of props
